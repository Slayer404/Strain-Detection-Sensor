# Strain Sensor Analog Circuit Research: Step-by-Step Roadmap

## 1. **Analog Circuit Exploration**

### Circuits to Test:

- **Non-Inverting Amplifier** (single supply, important for unidirectional voltage swings).
- **Inverting Amplifier** (for differential signal processing).
- **Voltage Divider** (basic resistance-to-voltage conversion).
- **Logarithmic (Log) Amplifier** (for exponential sensor response).
- **Anti-Log Amplifier** (inverse of log amp, for specific sensor outputs).
- **RC Circuit** (for filtering, signal smoothing, or transient response analysis).

## 2. **Sensor Stretching Hardware Setup**

- **Prepare Strain Application Rig:**
    - Design (or 3D print) a uniform stretching mechanism.
    - Use a **vernier caliper** for precise measurement of stretch (1mm, 2mm, 3mm increments).
- **Mount Market-Ready Flex Sensors** on rig and ensure reliable, repeatable stretching.

***

## 3. **Circuit Prototyping \& Data Collection**

### For Each Circuit Type:

- **Build Circuit:** Connect flex sensor and set up each type with appropriate biasing, supply, and measurement system.
- **Apply Controlled Strain:** Stretch sensor incrementally (1mm steps) and record output (voltage, current, resistance).
- **Compare Response Curves:** Plot voltage vs. strain and resistance vs. strain for each circuit.
- **Measure Hysteresis:** Perform loading (stretching) and unloading cycles—with each circuit, note if output lags behind input (hysteresis).
- **Histogram Plots:** For each circuit’s output, use histogram plots to analyze:
    - Distribution of sensor readings (spot consistency and noise).
    - Outlier, drift, or nonlinearity indications.
    - They help visualize stability, noise, and repeatability.

## 4. **Resistance Measurement \& Biasing Setup**

- **Find Sensor’s Max/Min Resistance:**
    - Use multimeter and stretching rig to record the resistance at minimum (no strain) and maximum (full strain) extension.
    - Typical expected range: ~15Ω–20Ω (verify experimentally).
- **Calculate Biasing Resistance:**
    - Use geometric mean:
        - If \$ R_{max} \$ and \$ R_{min} \$ are max and min values,
        - \$ R_bias = \sqrt{R_{max} \times R_{min}} \$
    - Choose a standard resistor value closest to this mean for use in the voltage divider or amplifier biasing.

## 5. **Analysis \& Comparison**

- **Assess Each Circuit:**
    - **Linearity:** How closely does output track strain application?
    - **Hysteresis:** Which circuit has lowest lag between stretch and release?
    - **Response Range:** Max/min output voltage spans.
    - **Sensitivity:** Minimum measurable change vs. noise level.
    - **Pros \& Cons:** Note complexity, cost, power supply needs, linearity, and noise.
- **Document All Findings:**
    - Record detailed circuit diagrams, test setups, raw data, plots (includes histogram and hysteresis curves).
    - Write up comparative notes: ease of implementation, best linearity, least hysteresis, practical considerations.

***

## 6. **Sensor Procurement \& Mass Testing**

- Request **multiple strain sensors** from vendor for batch testing.
- Repeat step 3 with several sensors to identify batch consistency, outlier traits, and average performance.

***

## 7. **Reporting \& Recommendation**

- Assemble all data, figures, and analysis.
- Clearly recommend the best circuit configuration for your goals (linearity, minimal hysteresis, simple single supply).
- Propose improvements to hardware, data analysis, and potential for integration.
